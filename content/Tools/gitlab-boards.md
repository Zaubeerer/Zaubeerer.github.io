Summary: In this article you will learn how to use boards in GitLab to organize your issues using agile methods.

many issues in different projects and groups = confusing?

It would be nice to organize issues in boards, as I described in the [GitHub project boards article]()?

It's possible in GitLab, too! And GitLab has a more automatized approach, that get's you up and running quicker.

So let's dive in.

## Initialization of a GitLab group with several subgroups and projects

manually

using import functions

## Creation of boards

No need to create anything, GitLab has you covered!

Go to issues > boards and voila, the boards are already available.

## Creation of columns

labels = columns

## board scope

## Further useful functionalities

- filtering
- additional lables "high priority" and "low priority"


## Summary & Conclusion

In this article, we have checked out how to use GitLabs `issue boards` to organize your issues into `columns`.

Therefore, we have used the built-in group and project boards. Using the columns `Open`, `To Do`, `Doing`, `Waiting for Feedback` and `Closed`, we can now intuitively visualize the progress of the issues.

Additionally, we can visualize the priority of the issues implicitly using the position (highest = highest priority) as well as explicitly using labels `high priority` and `low priority`.

As GitLab:
- automatization onboard
- board scopes

What are you waiting for? Get back control over all the open issues and manage them using `GitLab's boards`!

Whether you use the `project board` with [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum) or [KanBan](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban), it will simplify prioritization and visualization of progress.

This can also be a game-changer in communicating workload and available resources with your colleagues, your mentors or your boss.
