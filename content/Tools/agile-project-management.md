author: Robin Beer
summary: In this article, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using GitLab or GitHub for project management with agile methods.

## Agile Project Management

- Definition of Agile

- Scrum vs. Kanban Boards
- CI/CD
  - GitLab
  - GitHub

## Setup of Issues, Milestones and Scrum or KanBan boards: A Comparison between GitLab and GitHub

Table with descriptions (glossary)

### GitLab

- boards per repository or group
- Pros:
  - discussions in threads
  - hierarchical view of boards
  - global assignee boards
  - automatically add issues to boards

### GitHub

- boards per "project"

- Pros:
  - possibility of several assignees per issue (maybe disadvantage?)
  - customization of automatization rules

### TLDR: Conclusion

Whether GitLab or GitHub, both provide means to create powerful boards.

While Gitlab provides convenient automatizations such as board creation and adding-issues-to-boards out-of-the-box, GitHub might provide more customization potential.

Either way start using Boards to improve your agile project management.
