summary: In this article, I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using GitLab or GitHub for project management with agile methods.
status: draft

You are wondering whether to use GitHub or GitLab? Or you are using already one of the two and wonder whether the other has the same functionality and how to realize it?

Luckily, GitLab invited programmers to write about differences between GitLab and GitHub. Articles such as []() compare x, y, z. But when it comes to agile project management I haven't found any good comparison yet.

Having written on how to use GitLab boards and GitHub project boards to organize issues in an agile way using KanBan or Scrum, I will use those articles as a base to compare GitLab and GitHub in view of project management.

So let's dive into it.

## Agile Project Management

- Definition of Agile

- Scrum vs. Kanban Boards
- CI/CD
  - GitLab
  - GitHub

## Setup of I ssues, Milestones and Scrum or KanBan boards: A Comparison between GitLab and GitHub

Table with descriptions (glossary)

### GitLab

- boards per repository or group
- Pros:
  - discussions in threads
  - hierarchical view of boards
  - global assignee boards
  - automatically add issues to boards

### GitHub

- boards per "project"

- Pros:
  - possibility of several assignees per issue (maybe disadvantage?)
  - customization of automatization rules

### TLDR: Conclusion

Whether GitLab or GitHub, both provide means to create powerful boards.

While Gitlab provides convenient automatizations such as board creation and adding-issues-to-boards out-of-the-box, GitHub might provide more customization potential.

Either way start using Boards to improve your agile project management.
