I am an energy data scientist leveraging Python to accelerate the transition to a sustainable energy system.

To better understand the world and the energy supply system fundamentally, I studied physics at RWTH Aachen University. During my master's, I researched electrochemistry in France, manufacturing and analyzing batteries in the [Collège de France](https://www.college-de-france.fr), Paris.

Back in Germany, I wrote my master thesis on the influence of weather patterns on energy system analysis and worked as a student employee in the team data science at [Digital Energy Solutions](https://www.digital-energysolutions.de/en/).

Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Forschungszentrum Jülich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/iek/iek-3/EN/Home/home_node.html), analyzing the influence of spatial aggregation on the computational complexity of energy system analysis.

Along these studies, Python has proven to be my language of choice and I am constantly developing my skills, recently as a member of the [PyBites Developer Mindset Program](https://pybit.es).
